# FUTRIFIX Prototype

Minimal prototype: static frontend + Express server + JSON store.

## What it does
- Post jobs (customer)
- List technicians (demo)
- Technicians place bids on jobs
- Customer accepts a bid (marks job assigned)
- Demo data loader

This is a simple demo for the marketplace flows — NOT production-ready (no auth, no real payments, basic JSON persistence).

## Run locally

1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed.
2. Create the folder structure and files as provided.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
